## Limitations of Manual Resume Processing

### Inefficient Information Gathering

The manual process of collecting and organizing information is time-consuming and requires significant effort. This is in contrast to KaibanJS which can automatically extract structured information from user inputs.

### Inconsistent Formatting

Manual resume creation often leads to formatting inconsistencies. The process requires manual adjustments to maintain professional formatting standards, which can be error-prone and time-consuming.

### Content Writing and Rewriting Challenges

The manual process requires significant effort in crafting and editing content. Writing compelling and well-structured content by hand is labor-intensive, requiring multiple revisions and edits.
