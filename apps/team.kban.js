My name is Alex Navarro.
Go Developer for 6 years.
I worked for four years at Stripe, where I built scalable back-end microservices for their payment processing platform, focusing on distributed systems and API development using Go. Before Stripe, I was a Back-End Engineer at DigitalOcean, where I developed internal tools and improved the performance of customer-facing APIs.

Portfolio:
1. Real-Time Event Streaming Platform - Developed a real-time event streaming service using Kafka and Go, processing millions of events daily.
2. Cloud Cost Optimization Tool - Built a Go-based CLI for analyzing and reducing cloud infrastructure costs.
3. E-commerce Platform API - Designed and implemented RESTful APIs for a high-traffic online marketplace with Go and PostgreSQL.
4. Load Balancer for Microservices - Created a custom lightweight load balancer with Go to manage high-availability and request distribution.
5. CI/CD Pipeline Optimizer - Automated CI/CD workflows with Go-based scripts, reducing deployment times by 40%.

I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2017 and have been actively contributing to the open-source Go community.
